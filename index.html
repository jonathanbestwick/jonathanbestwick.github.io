                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I love the Lord Jesus and am wonderfully indebted to His grace, His plan for my life and to
                        praise Him in all I do, however menial. I thank God for the incredible blessing of my wife and
                        boys and for the way he has directed my life. I am passionate about being a catalyst in the
                        journey of young people fulfilling their potential and becoming more than they ever thought they
                        could be. Add the outdoors and the incredible tools of experiential learning and residential or
                        expedition camping to the mix and I am in my element. I am amazed by the human spirit and never
                        surprised by human frailties including my own. I love unique people and enjoy the challenge of
                        renewing messy or broken individuals. I am easily inspired by experienced people in the
                        Christian Camping industry and love to learn from them even at the expense of my own pride. I
                        tend to see the best in people and this is both a strength and a weakness. I don’t take myself
                        too seriously but am completely professional when needed.

                                    <p>I was originally employed to start and develop youth directed ministries at
                                        Skogheim. Impilo Neqiniso has been the primary ministry project that involved
                                        the designing of applicable and impactful programmes and the training of local
                                        facilitators to run specialized experiential learning camps for learners who
                                        can’t usually afford to go on “camp”. This required the raising of funds to
                                        cover the costs of such camps. I also oversaw the creation and running of the
                                        Daniel Generation Academy – An academy that funds and runs the tertiary
                                        development of deserving yet economically unfortunate students. This was an
                                        ongoing curriculum that lasts throughout the student’s tertiary education. It
                                        has been an incredible opportunity to design, run and facilitate unique
                                        programmes for specialised groups such as rehab centres, places of safety,
                                        special needs schools and provincial sports teams.</p>

                                    <p>As Team coordinator for Western Australia my position encompassed many roles. I
                                        worked primarily in Walpole in the South West. There I was in charge of
                                        coordinating
                                        all behind the scene logistics that come with running expedition based courses
                                        for up to 8 groups (140 participants) at a time. This included developing
                                        programmes, food ordering, gear and equipment management and also base camp and
                                        vehicle maintenance. Instructors lived and worked in this remote area for up to
                                        five months at a time. Managing and maintaining a positive work, as well as
                                        living environment for these instructors was also a large part of my job. I also
                                        maintained and nurtured relationships with the local parks associations and
                                        landowners. I spent time training staff and further developing and expanding the
                                        area. My responsibility as Team Coordinator was also to handle and coordinate
                                        any major incidents such as bushfires or medical evacuations. During the winter
                                        months of the year I worked in Eastern Australia developing and trialing new
                                        expedition areas. I occasionally instructed high profile courses where a high
                                        level of facilitation and experience was necessary</p>

                                    <p>My role was to lead wilderness expedition based personal development courses
                                        throughout Australia. Activities included high ropes courses, off trail
                                        navigation and bush walking. These expeditions catered to a full age range of
                                        cliental from adjudicated youth to corporate adults. The philosophy of Outward
                                        Bound is one of Learning through experience. Participants are put into
                                        situations where they are challenged physically, mentally and most significantly
                                        emotionally. All activities are carefully framed, facilitated and debriefed to
                                        achieve the highest learning outcomes possible. As the instructor I carefully
                                        and strategically nurtured the group process. All stages of the group and
                                        individual development are facilitated. Safety and the importance of balancing
                                        fun, challenge and learning is also a major role of the facilitation. Service is

                                    <p>A Non Profit NGO that runs expedition based programmes around South Africa. Their
                                        primary objective is to help South African’s realize their limitless potential
                                        through powerful group facilitation techniques and using the outdoors as an
                                        experiential learning tool.</p>
                                    <p>My role here was to lead outdoor personal development courses for extended
                                        periods of up to 21 days, focusing on adjudicated and disadvantage youths as
                                        well as school and corporate groups. The youth at risk were part of the
                                        Chrysalis developmental programmes in Cape Town. Many of these youths were
                                        recently released from juvenile prison and were particularly interesting to
                                        handle and develop. Whilst 21day expeditions alone with these types of
                                        individuals were particularly challenging it was also the most powerfully
                                        rewarding experience of my young life. The principles that Outward Bound was
                                        built on and the ability for the wilderness programmes to significantly improve
                                        the attitudes and aspirations of these individuals was awe inspiring.</p>
